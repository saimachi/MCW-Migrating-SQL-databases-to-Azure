# Migrating SQL databases to Azure hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you implement a proof-of-concept (PoC) for migrating an on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database into Azure SQL Managed Instance (SQL MI). You perform assessments to reveal any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database and Azure's managed database offerings. You then migrate the customer's on-premises gamer information web application and database into Azure, with minimal down-time. Finally, you enable some of the advanced SQL features in SQL MI to improve security and performance in the customer's application.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to implement a cloud migration solution for business-critical applications and databases.

## Overview

Wide World Importers (WWI) is the developer of the popular Tailspin Toys brand of online video games. Founded in 2010, the company has experienced exponential growth since releasing the first installment of their most popular game franchise to include online multiplayer gameplay. They have since built upon this success by adding online capabilities to the majority of their game portfolio.

Adding online gameplay has dramatically increased their games' popularity, but the rapid increase in demand for their services has made supporting the current setup problematic. To facilitate online gameplay, they host gaming services on-premises using rented hardware. For each game, their gaming services setup consists of three virtual machines running the gaming software and five game databases hosted on a single SQL Server 2008 R2 instance. In addition to the dedicated gaming VMs and databases, they also host shared authentication and gateway VMs and databases. At its foundation, WWI is a game development company made up primarily of software developers. The few dedicated database and infrastructure resources they do have are struggling to keep up with their ever-increasing workload.

WWI is excited to learn more about how migrating to the cloud can improve its overall processes and address the concerns and issues with its on-premises setup. They are looking for a proof-of-concept (PoC) for migrating their gaming VMs and databases into the cloud. With an end goal of migrating their entire service to Azure, the WWI engineering team is also interested in understanding better what their overall architecture will look like in the cloud. They maintain their gamer information database, `WideWorldImporters`, on an on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database. This system is used by gamers to update their profiles, view leader boards, purchase game add-ons, and more. Since this system helps drive revenue, it is considered a business-critical application and needs to be highly available. They are aware that SQL Server 2008 R2 is beyond the end of support and are looking at options for migrating this database into Azure. They have read about some of the advanced security and performance tuning options that are available only in Azure and would prefer to migrate the database into a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering, if possible. WWI uses the Service Broker feature of SQL Server for messaging within its `WideWorldImporters` database. This functionality enables several critical processes, and they cannot afford to lose these capabilities when migrating their operations database to the cloud. They have also stated that, at this time, they do not have the resources to rearchitect the solution to use an alternative message broker.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you implement in this lab. Please study this carefully to understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![This solution diagram includes a virtual network containing SQL MI in an isolated subnet, along with a JumpBox VM and Database Migration Service in a management subnet. The MI Subnet displays both the primary managed instance and a read-only replica, which is accessed by reports from the web app. The web app connects to SQL MI via a subnet gateway and point-to-site VPN. The web app is published to App Services using Visual Studio 2019. Online data migration is conducted from the on-premises SQL Server to SQL MI using the Azure Database Migration Service, which reads backup files from an SMB network share.](./media/preferred-solution-architecture.png "Preferred Solution diagram")

The solution begins with using the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to perform assessments of feature parity and compatibility of the on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database. DMA assessments are performed against Azure SQL Database (Azure SQL DB) and Azure SQL Managed Instance (SQL MI). The goal is to migrate the `WideWorldImporters` database into an Azure PaaS offering with minimal or no application changes. After completing the assessments and reviewing the findings, the SQL Server 2008 R2 database is migrated into SQL MI using the Azure Database Migration Service's online data migration option. The online data migration feature of DMS allows the database migration to happen with minimal downtime, using a backup and transaction logs stored in an SMB network share.

The web app is deployed to an Azure App Service Web App using Visual Studio 2019. Once the migrated database's cutover is complete, VNet integration for the `WideWorldImporters` web application is configured. This integration allows the web app to connect to the SQL MI VNet through a virtual network gateway using a point-to-site VPN. The web app's connection strings are updated to point to the new SQL MI database.

In SQL MI, several features of Azure SQL are examined. Azure Defender for SQL is enabled, and Data Discovery and Classification is used to understand better the data and potential compliance issues with data in the database. The Azure Defender for SQL Vulnerability Assessment tool is used to identify potential security vulnerabilities and problems in the database. Those issues listed in the assessment report are used to mitigate one finding by enabling Transparent Data Encryption in the database. Dynamic Data Masking (DDM) is used to prevent sensitive data from appearing when querying the database. Finally, Read Scale-out is used to point reports on WWI's web app to a read-only secondary, allowing reporting to occur without impacting the primary database's performance.

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.
  - Trial subscriptions will not work.
- A virtual machine configured with Visual Studio Community 2019 or higher (setup in the Before the hands-on lab exercises).
- **Important**: You must have sufficient rights within your Azure AD tenant to create an Azure Active Directory application and service principal and assign roles on your subscription to complete this hands-on lab.

## Exercise 1: Perform database assessments

Duration: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you use the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to perform assessments on the `WideWorldImporters` database. You create two assessments: one for SQL DB and a second for SQL MI. These assessments provide reports about any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the Azure managed SQL database service options.

> DMA helps you upgrade to a modern data platform by detecting compatibility issues that can impact database functionality in your new version of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database. DMA recommends performance and reliability improvements for your target environment and allows you to move your schema, data, and uncontained objects from your source server to your target server. To learn more, read the [Data Migration Assistant documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/dma/dma-overview?view=azuresqldb-mi-current).

### Task 1: Connect to the WideWorldImporters database on the SqlServer2008 VM

In this task, you perform some configuration for the `WideWorldImporters` database on the SQL Server 2008 R2 instance to prepare it for migration.

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select **Resource groups** from the Azure services list.

   ![Resource groups is highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-resource-groups.png "Azure services")

2. Select the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group from the list.

   ![Resource groups is selected in the Azure navigation pane, and the "hands-on-lab-SUFFIX" resource group is highlighted.](./media/resource-groups.png "Resource groups list")

3. In the list of resources for your resource group, select the SqlServer2008 VM.

   ![The SqlServer2008 VM is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/resource-list-sqlserver2008.png "Resource list")

4. On the SqlServer2008 VM blade in the Azure portal, select **Overview** from the left-hand menu, and then select **Connect** and **RDP** on the top menu, as you've done previously.

   ![The SqlServer2008 VM blade is displayed, with the Connect button highlighted in the top menu.](./media/connect-vm-rdp.png "Connect to SqlServer2008 VM")

5. On the Connect with RDP blade, select **Download RDP File**, then open the downloaded RDP file.

6. Select **Connect** on the Remote Desktop Connection dialog.

   ![In the Remote Desktop Connection Dialog Box, the Connect button is highlighted.](./media/remote-desktop-connection-sql-2008.png "Remote Desktop Connection dialog")

   - **Username**: `sqlmiuser`
   - **Password**: `Password.1234567890`

   ![The credentials specified above are entered into the Enter your credentials dialog.](media/rdc-credentials-sql-2008.png "Enter your credentials")

8. Select **Yes** to connect if prompted the remote computer's identity cannot be verified.

   ![In the Remote Desktop Connection dialog box, a warning states the remote computer's identity cannot be verified and asks if you want to continue anyway. At the bottom, the Yes button is circled.](./media/remote-desktop-connection-identity-verification-sqlserver2008.png "Remote Desktop Connection dialog")

9. Once logged in, open **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17** (SSMS) by entering "sql server" into the search bar in the Windows Start menu and selecting **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17** from the search results.

   ![SQL Server is entered into the Windows Start menu search box, and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17 is highlighted in the search results.](media/start-menu-ssms-17.png "Windows start menu search")

10. In the SSMS **Connect to Server** dialog, enter **SQLSERVER2008** into the Server name box, ensure **Windows Authentication** is selected, and then select **Connect**.

    ![The SQL Server Connect to Search dialog is displayed, with SQLSERVER2008 entered into the Server name and Windows Authentication selected.](media/sql-server-connect-to-server.png "Connect to Server")

11. Once connected, verify you see the `WideWorldImporters` database listed under databases.

    ![The WideWorldImporters database is highlighted under Databases on the SQLSERVER2008 instance.](media/wide-world-importers-database.png "WideWorldImporters database")

    > **Important**
    >
    > If you do not see the `WideWorldImporters` database listed, the configuration script used by the ARM template may have failed during the VM setup. In this case, you should follow the steps under Task 12 of the [Manual-resource-setup guide](./Manual-resource-setup.md) to **manually restore and configure the database**.

### Task 2: Perform assessment for migration to Azure SQL Database

In this task, you use the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to assess the `WideWorldImporters` database against Azure SQL Database (Azure SQL DB). The assessment provides a report about any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the Azure SQL DB service.

#### Install Framework 4.8

As **Microsoft Data Migration Assistant** requires framework 4.8 to operate, install as instructed below: 

   ![Migration assistant require framework .Net 4.8.](media/download-framework-4-8.png "Download framework 4.8")

1. Download the offline setup file from [Microsoft Site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2088631) by pasting `https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2088631` into an Internet Explorer address bar.

2. **Download** and **Run** the installation package to proceed with new .Net framework 4.8 setup.

The Service broker feature is selected on the left and on the right Service Broker feature is not supported in Azure SQL Database is highlighted.](media/dma-feature-parity-service-broker-not-supported.png "Database feature parity")

    > **Note**: The DMA assessment for migrating the `WideWorldImporters` database to a target platform of Azure SQL DB reveals features in use that are not supported. These features, including Service broker, prevent WWI from migrating to the Azure SQL DB PaaS offering without making changes to their database.

11. **Cancel** migration for this project by going **back** to home page.

    ![Cancel migration by going back to home page.](media/dma-cancel-project-migration.png "Cancel project migration")

### Task 3: Perform assessment for migration to Azure SQL Managed Instance

With one PaaS offering ruled out due to feature parity, perform a second DMA assessment against Azure SQL Managed Instance (SQL MI). The assessment provides a report about any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the SQL MI service.

1. To get started, select **+** on the left-hand menu in DMA to create another new project.

   ![The new project icon is highlighted in DMA.](media/dma-new.png "New DMA project")

2. In the New project pane, set the following:

   - **Project name**: Enter `ToSqlMi`
   - **Target server type**: Select **Azure SQL Database Managed Instance**.

3. Select **Create**.

   ![The new project settings for doing a SQL Server to Azure SQL Managed Instance migration assessment are entered into the dialog.](media/dma-new-project-to-sql-mi.png "New project settings")

4. On the **Options** screen, ensure **Check database compatibility** and **Check feature parity** are checked and then select **Next**.

   ![Check database compatibility and check feature parity are checked on the Options screen.](media/dma-options.png "DMA options")

5. On the **Sources** screen, enter the following into the **Connect to a server** dialog that appears on the right-hand side:

   - **Server name**: Select **SQLSERVER2008**.
   - **Authentication type**: Select **SQL Server Authentication**.
   - **Username**: Enter `WorkshopUser`
   - **Password**: Enter `Password.1234567890`
   - **Encrypt connection**: Check this box.
   - **Trust server certificate**: Check this box.

   ![In the Connect to a server dialog, the values specified above are entered.](media/dma-connect-to-a-server.png "Connect to a server")

6. Select **Connect**.

7. On the **Add sources** dialog that appears next, check the box for **WideWorldImporters** and select **Add**.

   ![The WideWorldImporters box is checked on the Add sources dialog.](media/dma-add-sources.png "Add sources")

8. Select **Start Assessment**.

   ![Start assessment](media/dma-start-assessment-to-azure-sql-db.png "Start assessment")

9. Review the **SQL Server feature parity** issues options of the migration assessment to determine the possibility of migrating to Azure SQL Managed Instance.

   ![For a target platform of Azure SQL Managed Instance, no issues are listed.](media/dma-feature-parity-sql-mi.png "Database feature parity")

10. Review the **Compatibility issues** options of the migration assessment to determine the possibility of migrating to Azure SQL Managed Instance.

   ![For a target platform of Azure SQL Managed Instance, a message that full-text search has changed, and the list of impacted objects are listed.](media/dma-compatibility-issues-sql-mi.png "Compatibility issues")

   > **Note**: The assessment report for migrating the `WideWorldImporters` database to a target platform of Azure SQL Managed Instance shows no feature parity and a note to validate full-text search functionality. The full-text search changes do not impact the migration of the `WideWorldImporters` database to SQL MI.

The database, including the Service Broker feature, can be migrated as is, providing an opportunity for WWI to have a fully managed PaaS database running in Azure. Previously, their only option for migrating a database using features incompatible with Azure SQL Database, such as Service Broker, was to deploy the database to a virtual machine running in Azure (IaaS) or modify the database and associated applications to remove the use of the unsupported features. The introduction of Azure SQL MI, however, provides the ability to migrate databases into a managed Azure SQL database service with _near 100% compatibility_, including the features that prevented them from using Azure SQL Database.

You can close **Data Migration Assistant** by double-clicking the program icon. Also, **confirm** you are **not saving projects**, as you have another migration process in mind right now.

   ![Close data migration assistant.](media/dma-close-data-migration-assistant.png "Close data migration assistant")

## Exercise 2: Migrate the database to SQL MI

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you use the [Azure Database Migration Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/database-migration/) (DMS) to migrate the `WideWorldImporters` database from an on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database into Azure SQL Managed Instance (SQL MI). WWI mentioned the importance of their gamer information web application in driving revenue, so for this migration, the online migration option is used to minimize downtime. Targeting the [Business Critical service tier](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/sql-managed-instance-paas-overview#managed-instance-service-tiers) allows WWI to meet its customer's high-availability requirements.

> The Business Critical service tier is designed for business applications with the highest performance and high-availability (HA) requirements. To learn more, read the [Managed Instance service tiers documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/sql-managed-instance-paas-overview#service-tiers).

### Task 1: Create an SMB network share on the SqlServer2008 VM

In this task, you create a new SMB network share on the SqlServer2008 VM. DMS uses this shared folder for retrieving backups of the `WideWorldImporters` database during the database migration process.

1. On the SqlServer2008 VM, open **Windows Explorer** by selecting its icon on the Windows Taskbar.

   ![The Windows Explorer icon is highlighted in the Windows Taskbar.](media/windows-task-bar.png "Windows Taskbar")

2. In the Windows Explorer window, expand **Computer** in the tree view, select **Windows (C:)**, and then select **New folder** in the top menu.

   ![In Windows Explorer, Windows (C:) is selected under Computer in the left-hand tree view, and New folder is highlighted in the top menu.](media/windows-explorer-new-folder.png "Windows Explorer")

3. Name the new folder **dms-backups**, then right-click the folder and select **Share with** and **Specific people** in the context menu.

   ![In Windows Explorer, the context menu for the dms-backups folder is displayed, with Share with and Specific people highlighted.](media/windows-explorer-folder-share-with.png "Windows Explorer")

4. In the File Sharing dialog, ensure the **sqlmiuser** is listed with a **Read/Write** permission level, and then select **Share**.

   ![In the File Sharing dialog, the sqlmiuser is highlighted and assigned a permission level of Read/Write.](media/file-sharing.png "File Sharing")

5. In the **Network discovery and file sharing** dialog, select the default value of **No, make the network that I am connected to a private network**.

   ![In the Network discovery and file sharing dialog, No, make the network that I am connected to a private network is highlighted.](media/network-discovery-and-file-sharing.png "Network discovery and file sharing")

6. Back on the File Sharing dialog, note the shared folder's path, `\\SQLSERVER2008\dms-backups`, and select **Done** to complete the sharing process.

   ![The Done button is highlighted on the File Sharing dialog.](media/file-sharing-done.png "File Sharing")

### Task 2: Change MSSQLSERVER service to run under sqlmiuser account

In this task, you use the SQL Server Configuration Manager to update the service account used by the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service to the `sqlmiuser` account. Changing the account used for this service ensures it has the appropriate permissions to write backups to the shared folder.

1. On your SqlServer2008 VM, select the **Start menu**, enter **sql configuration** into the search bar, and then select **SQL Server Configuration Managed** from the search results.

   ![In the Windows Start menu, "sql configuration" is entered into the search box, and SQL Server Configuration Manager is highlighted in the search results.](media/windows-start-sql-configuration-manager.png "Windows search")

   > **Note**: Be sure to choose **SQL Server Configuration Manager**, and not **SQL Server 2017 Configuration Manager**, which does not work for the installed SQL Server 2008 R2 database.

2. In the SQL Server Configuration Managed dialog, select **SQL Server Services** from the tree view on the left, then right-click **SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)** in the list of services and select **Properties** from the context menu.

   ![SQL Server Services is selected and highlighted in the tree view of the SQL Server Configuration Manager. In the Services pane, SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) is selected and highlighted.

   ![In the list of SQL Server Services, the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service is highlighted.](media/sql-server-service.png "SQL Server Services")

7. **Close** the SQL Server Configuration Manager.

### Task 3: Create a backup of the WideWorldImporters database

To perform online data migrations, DMS looks for database and transaction log backups in the shared SMB backup folder on the source database server. In this task, you create a backup of the `WideWorldImporters` database using SSMS and write it to the `\\SQLSERVER2008\dms-backups` SMB network share you made in a previous task. The backup file needs to include a checksum, so you add that during the backup steps.

1. On the SqlServer2008 VM, open **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17** by entering **microsoft sql** into the search bar in the Windows Start menu.

   ![SQL Server is entered into the Windows Start menu search box, and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17 is highlighted in the search results.](media/start-menu-ssms-17.png "Windows start menu search")

2. In the SSMS **Connect to Server** dialog, enter **SQLSERVER2008** into the Server name box, ensure **Windows Authentication** is selected, and then select **Connect**.

   ![The SQL Server Connect to Search dialog is displayed, with SQLSERVER2008 entered into the Server name and Windows Authentication selected.](media/sql-server-connect-to-server.png "Connect to Server")

   ![In the You have no storage mounted dialog, a subscription has been selected, and the Create Storage button is highlighted.](media/cloud-shell-create-storage.png "Azure Cloud Shell")

   > **Note**: If the creation fails, you may need to select **Advanced settings** and specify the subscription, region, and resource group for the new storage account.

4. After a moment, a message is displayed that you have successfully requested a Cloud Shell, and you are presented with a PS Azure prompt.

   ![In the Azure Cloud Shell dialog, a message is displayed that requesting a Cloud Shell succeeded, and the PS Azure prompt is displayed.](media/cloud-shell-ps-azure-prompt.png "Azure Cloud Shell")

5. At the prompt, retrieve the public IP address of the SqlSerer2008 VM. This IP address will be used to connect to the database on that server. Enter the following PowerShell command, **replacing `<your-resource-group-name>`** in the resource group name variable with the name of your resource group:

   ```powershell
   $resourceGroup = "<your-resource-group-name>"
   az vm list-ip-addresses -g $resourceGroup -n SqlServer2008 --output table
   ```

   > **Note**: If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, and the account you are using for this hands-on lab is not your default account, you may need to run `az account list --output table` at the Azure Cloud Shell prompt to output a list of your subscriptions, then copy the Subscription Id of the account you are using for this lab and then run `az account set --subscription <your-subscription-id>` to set the appropriate account for the Azure CLI commands.

6. Within the output, locate and copy the value of the `ipAddress` property below the `PublicIPAddresses` field. Paste the value into a text editor, such as **Notepad.exe** or **VSCode**, for later reference.

   ![The output from the az vm list-ip-addresses command is displayed in the Cloud Shell, and the public IP address for the SqlServer2008 VM is highlighted.](media/cloud-shell-az-vm-list-ip-addresses.png "Azure Cloud Shell")

7. Leave the Azure Cloud Shell open for the next task.

### Task 5: Create a service principal

In this task, use the Azure Cloud Shell to create an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) application and service principal (SP) that will provide DMS access to Azure SQL MI. You will grant the SP permissions to the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group and your subscription.

> **Important**: You must have sufficient rights within your Azure AD tenant to create an Azure Active Directory application and service principal and assign roles on your subscription to complete this task.

1. Next, at the Cloud Shell prompt, issue a command to create a service principal named **wide-world-importers** and assign it contributor permissions to your **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group.

2. First, you need to retrieve your subscription ID. Enter the following at the Cloud Shell prompt:

   ```powershell
   az account list --output table
   ```

3. In the output table, locate the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab. Copy the SubscriptionId value and use it to replace `<your-subscription-id>` in the command below. Run the completed command at the CLI command prompt.

   ```powershell
   $subscriptionId = "<your-subscription-id>"
   ```

4. Next, enter the following `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command at the Cloud Shell prompt and then press `Enter` to run the command.

   ```powershell
   az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "https://wide-world-importers" --role contributor --scopes subscriptions/$subscriptionId/resourceGroups/$resourceGroup
   ```

5. Copy the output from the command into a text editor, as you need the `appId` and `password` in the next task. The output should be similar to:

   ```json
   {
     "appId": "aeab3b83-9080-426c-94a3-4828db8532e9",
     "displayName": "wide-world-importers",

    ![In the migration monitoring window, a status of Log shipping in progress is highlighted.](media/dms-migration-wizard-status-log-files-uploading.png "Migration status")

You can leave Azure Portal browser window open and come back to check that migration is complete. This is a perfect time for a break.

### Task 7: Perform migration cutover

Since you performed an "online data migration," the migration wizard continuously monitors the SMB network share for newly added log backup files. Online migrations enable any updates on the source database to be captured until you initiate the cutover to the SQL MI database. In this task, you add a record to one of the database tables, backup the logs, and complete the migration of the `WideWorldImporters` database by cutting over to the SQL MI database.

1. In the Azure portal's migration status window, select **WideWorldImporters** under database name to view further details about the database migration.

   ![The WideWorldImporters database name is highlighted in the migration status window.](media/dms-migration-wizard-database-name.png "Migration status")

   ![On the WideWorldImporters blade, a status of Restored is highlighted next to the WideWorldImporters.bak file in the list of active backup files.](media/dms-migration-wizard-database-restored.png "Migration Wizard")

3. To demonstrate log shipping and how transactions made on the source database during the migration process are added to the target SQL MI database, you will add a record to one of the database tables.

4. Return to SSMS on your SqlServer2008 VM and select **New Query** from the toolbar.

   ![The New Query button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/ssms-new-query.png "SSMS Toolbar")

5. Paste the following SQL script, which inserts a record into the `Game` table, into the new query window:

   ```sql
   USE WideWorldImporters;
   GO

   INSERT [dbo].[Game] (Title, Description, Rating, IsOnlineMultiplayer)
   VALUES ('Space Adventure', 'Explore the universe with our newest online multiplayer gaming experience. Build custom  rocket ships, and take off for the stars in an infinite open-world adventure.', 'T', 1)
   ```

6. Execute the query by selecting **Execute** in the SSMS toolbar.

   ![The Execute button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/ssms-execute.png "SSMS Toolbar")

7. After adding the new record to the `Games` table, back up the transaction logs. DMS detects any new backups and ships them to the migration service. Select **New Query** again in the toolbar, and paste the following script into the new query window:

   ```sql
   USE master;
   GO

   BACKUP LOG WideWorldImporters
   TO DISK = 'c:\dms-backups\WideWorldImportersLog.trn'
   WITH CHECKSUM
   GO
   ```

8. Execute the query by selecting **Execute** in the SSMS toolbar.

9. Return to the migration status page in the Azure portal. On the WideWorldImporters screen, select **Refresh**, and you should see the **WideWorldImportersLog.trn** file appear with a status of **Queued**.

   ![On the WideWorldImporters blade, the Refresh button is highlighted. A status of Uploaded is highlighted next to the WideWorldImportersLog.trn file in the list of active backup files.](media/dms-migration-wizard-transaction-log-queued.png "Migration wizard")

10. Continue selecting **Refresh**, and you should see the **WideWorldImportersLog.trn** status change to **Uploaded**.

    ![A status of Uploaded is highlighted next to the WideWorldImportersLog.trn file in the list of active backup files.](media/dms-migration-wizard-transaction-log-uploaded.png "Migration Wizard")

11. After the transaction logs are uploaded, they are restored to the database. Once again, continue selecting **Refresh** every 10-15 seconds until you see the status change to **Restored**, which can take a minute or two.

    ![A status of Restored is highlighted next to the WideWorldImportersLog.trn file in the list of active backup files.](media/dms-migration-wizard-transaction-log-restored.png "Migration Wizard")

12. After verifying the transaction log status of **Restored**, select **Start Cutover**.

    ![The Start Cutover button is displayed.](media/dms-migration-wizard-start-cutover.png "DMS Migration Wizard")

13. On the Complete cutover dialog, verify pending log backups is `0`, check **Confirm**, and then select **Apply**.

    ![In the Complete cutover dialog, 0 is highlighted next to Pending log backups, and the Confirm checkbox is checked.](media/dms-migration-wizard-complete-cutover-apply.png "Migration Wizard")

14. A progress bar below the Apply button in the Complete cutover dialog provides updates on the cutover status. When the migration finishes, the status changes to **Completed**.

    ![A status of Completed is displayed in the Complete cutover dialog.](media/dms-migration-wizard-complete-cutover-completed.png "Migration Wizard")

    > **Note**: If the progress bar has not moved after a few minutes, you can proceed to the next step and monitor the cutover progress on the WwiMigration blade by selecting refresh.

15. To return to the WwiMigration blade, close the Complete cutover dialog by selecting the "X" in the upper right corner of the dialog, and do the same thing for the WideWorldImporters blade. Select **Refresh**, and you should see a status of **Completed** from the WideWorldImporters database.

    ![On the Migration job blade, the status of Completed is highlighted.](media/dms-migration-wizard-status-complete.png "Migration with Completed status")

16. You have successfully migrated the `WideWorldImporters` database to Azure SQL Managed Instance.

## Exercise 5: Improve database security posture with Data Discovery and Classification and Azure Defender for SQL

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you enable set up some of the advanced security features of SQL MI and explore some of the security benefits that come with running your database in Azure. [Azure Defender for SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/azure-defender-for-sql) provides advanced SQL security capabilities, including functionality for surfacing and mitigating potential database vulnerabilities and detecting anomalous activities that could indicate a threat to your database. Also, [Data Discovery and Classification](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/data-discovery-and-classification-overview) allows you to discover and classify sensitive data within the database.

### Task 1: Configure Data Discovery and Classification

In this task, you review the [Data Discovery and Classification](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/data-discovery-and-classification-overview) feature of Azure SQL. Data Discovery & Classification introduces a new tool for discovering, classifying, labeling, and reporting sensitive data in your databases. It introduces a set of advanced services, forming a new SQL Information Protection paradigm aimed at protecting the data in your database, not just the database. Discovering and classifying your most sensitive data (e.g., business, financial, healthcare) can play a pivotal role in your organizational information protection stature.

1. On the WideWorldImporters Managed database blade, select the **Data Discovery & Classification** from the left-hand menu.

2. In the **Data Discovery & Classification** blade, select the info link with the message, **We have found 35 columns with classification recommendations**.

   ![The Data Discovery & Classification tile is displayed.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-pane.png "Data Discovery & Classification Dashboard")

3. Look over the list of recommendations to get a better understanding of the types of data and classifications that can be assigned, based on the built-in classification settings. In the list of classification recommendations, select the recommendation for the **Sales - CreditCard - CardNumber** field.

   ![The CreditCard number recommendation is highlighted in the recommendations list.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-recommendations-credit-card.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

4. Due to the risk of exposing credit card information, WWI would like a way to classify it as highly confidential, not just **Confidential**, as the recommendation suggests. To correct this, select **+ Add classification** at the top of the Data Discovery & Classification blade.

   ![The +Add classification button is highlighted in the toolbar.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-add-classification-button.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

5. Quickly expand the **Sensitivity label** field, and review the various built-in labels from which you can choose. You can also add custom labels, should you desire.

   ![The list of built-in Sensitivity labels is displayed.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-sensitivity-labels.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

6. In the Add classification dialog, enter the following:

   - **Schema name**: Select **Sales**.
   - **Table name**: Select **CreditCard**.
   - **Column name**: Select **CardNumber (nvarchar)**.
   - **Information type**: Select **Credit Card**.
   - **Sensitivity level**: Select **Highly Confidential**.

7. Select **Add classification**.

   ![The values specified above are entered into the Add classification dialog.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-add-classification.png "Add classification")

8. Notice the **Sales - CreditCard - CardNumber** field disappears from the recommendations list, and the number of recommendations drops by 1.

9. Select **Save** on the toolbar of the Data Classification window. It may take several minutes for the save to complete.

   ![Save the updates to the classified columns list.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-save-button.png "Save")

10. Other recommendations you can review are the **HumanResources - Employee** fields for **NationIDNumber** and **BirthDate**. Note the recommendation service flagged these fields as **Confidential - GDPR**. WWI maintains data about gamers from around the world, including Europe, so having a tool that helps them discover data that may be relevant to GDPR compliance is very helpful.

    ![GDPR information is highlighted in the list of recommendations](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-recommendations-gdpr.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

11. Check the **Select all** checkbox at the top of the list to select all the remaining recommended classifications, and then select **Accept selected recommendations**.

12. Select **Save** on the toolbar of the Data Classification window. It may take several minutes for the save to complete.

    > Using the SQL Vulnerability Assessment, it is simple to identify and remediate potential database vulnerabilities, allowing you to improve your database security proactively.

## Exercise 6: Enable Dynamic Data Masking

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you enable [Dynamic Data Masking](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-dynamic-data-masking-get-started) (DDM) on credit card numbers in the `WideWorldImporters` database. DDM limits sensitive data exposure by masking it to non-privileged users. This feature helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data by enabling customers to designate how much of the sensitive data to reveal with minimal impact on the application layer. It is a policy-based security feature that hides the sensitive data in the result set of a query over designated database fields while the data in the database is not changed.

For example, a call center's service representative may identify callers by several digits of their credit card number. However, the full credit card number should not be fully exposed to the service representative. A masking rule can be defined that obfuscates all but the last four digits of any credit card number in any query result. As another example, an appropriate data mask can be created to protect personally identifiable information (PII) data so that a developer can query production environments for troubleshooting purposes without violating compliance regulations.

### Task 1: Enable DDM on credit card numbers

When inspecting the data in the `WideWorldImporters` database using the ADS Data Discovery & Classification tool, you set the Sensitivity label for credit card numbers to Highly Confidential. In this task, you take another step to protect this information by enabling DDM on the `CardNumber` field in the `CreditCard` table. DDM prevents queries against that table from returning the full credit card number.

1. On your JumpBox VM, return to the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) window you opened previously.

2. Expand **Tables** under the **WideWorldImporters** database and locate the `Sales.CreditCard` table. Expand the table columns and observe that there is a column named `CardNumber`. Right-click the table, and choose **Select Top 1000 Rows** from the context menu.

   ![The Select Top 1000 Rows item is highlighted in the context menu for the Sales.CreditCard table.](media/ssms-sql-mi-credit-card-table-select.png "Select Top 1000 Rows")

3. In the query window that opens review the Results, including the `CardNumber` field. Notice it is displayed in plain text, making the data available to anyone with access to query the database.

   ![Plain text credit card numbers are highlighted in the query results.](media/ssms-sql-mi-credit-card-table-select-results.png "Results")

4. To be able to test the mask being applied to the `CardNumber` field, you first create a user in the database to use for testing the masked field. In SSMS, select **New Query** and paste the following SQL script into the new query window:

   ```sql
   USE [WideWorldImporters];
   GO

   CREATE USER DDMUser WITHOUT LOGIN;
   GRANT SELECT ON [Sales].[CreditCard] TO DDMUser;
   ```

   > The SQL script above creates a new user in the database named `DDMUser` and grants that user `SELECT` rights on the `Sales.CreditCard` table.

5. Select **Execute** from the SSMS toolbar to run the query. You will get a message the commands completed successfully in the Messages pane.

6. With the new user created, run a quick query to observe the results. Select **New Query** again, and paste the following into the new query window.

   ```sql
   USE [WideWorldImporters];
   GO

   EXECUTE AS USER = 'DDMUser';
   SELECT TOP 10 * FROM [Sales].[CreditCard];
   REVERT;
   ```

7. Select **Execute** from the toolbar and examine the Results pane. Notice the credit card number, as above, is visible in plain text.

   ![The credit card number is unmasked in the query results.](media/ssms-sql-mi-ddm-results-unmasked.png "Query results")

8. You now apply DDM on the `CardNumber` field to prevent it from being viewed in query results. Select **New Query** from the SSMS toolbar,  paste the following query into the query window to apply a mask to the `CardNumber` field and then select **Execute**.

   ```sql
   USE [WideWorldImporters];
   GO

   ALTER TABLE [Sales].[CreditCard]
   ALTER COLUMN [CardNumber] NVARCHAR(25) MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'partial(0,"xxx-xxx-xxx-",4)')
   ```

9. Run the `SELECT` query you opened in step 6 above again, and observe the results. Specifically, inspect the output in the `CardNumber` field. For reference, the query is below.

   ```sql
   USE [WideWorldImporters];
   GO

   EXECUTE AS USER = 'DDMUser';
   SELECT TOP 10 * FROM [Sales].[CreditCard];
   REVERT;
   ```

   ![The credit card number is masked in the query results.](media/ssms-sql-mi-ddm-results-masked.png "Query results")

   > The `CardNumber` is now displayed using the mask applied to it, so only the card number's last four digits are visible. Dynamic Data Masking is a powerful feature that enables you to prevent unauthorized users from viewing sensitive or restricted information. It's a policy-based security feature that hides the sensitive data in the result set of a query over designated database fields while the data in the database is not changed.

### Task 2: Apply DDM to email addresses

From the findings of the Data Discovery & Classification report in ADS, you saw that email addresses are labeled Confidential. In this task, you use one of the built-in functions for making email addresses using DDM to help protect this information.

1. For this, you target the `LoginEmail` field in the `[dbo].[Gamer]` table. Open a new query window and execute the following script:

   ```sql
   USE [WideWorldImporters];
   GO

   SELECT TOP 10 * FROM [dbo].[Gamer]
   ```

   ![In the query results, full email addresses are visible.](media/ddm-select-gamer-results.png "Query results")

2. Now, as you did above, grant the `DDMUser` `SELECT` rights on the [dbo].[Gamer]. In a new query window and enter the following script, and then select **Execute**:

   ```sql
   USE [WideWorldImporters];
   GO

   GRANT SELECT ON [dbo].[Gamer] to DDMUser;
   ```

3. Next, apply DDM on the `LoginEmail` field to prevent it from being viewed in full in query results. Select **New Query** from the SSMS toolbar, paste the following query into the query window to apply a mask to the `LoginEmail` field, and then select **Execute**.

   ```sql
   USE [WideWorldImporters];
   GO

   ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Gamer]
   ALTER COLUMN [LoginEmail] NVARCHAR(250) MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'Email()');
   ```

   > **Note**: Observe the use of the built-in `Email()` masking function above. This masking function is one of several pre-defined masks available in SQL Server databases.

4. Run the `SELECT` query below, and observe the results. Specifically, inspect the output in the `LoginEmail` field. For reference, the query is below.

   ```sql
   USE [WideWorldImporters];
   GO

   EXECUTE AS USER = 'DDMUser';
   SELECT TOP 10 * FROM [dbo].[Gamer];
   REVERT;
   ```

   ![The email addresses are masked in the query results.](media/ddm-select-gamer-results-masked.png "Query results")

## Exercise 7: Use online secondary for read-only queries

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you examine how you can use the automatically created online secondary for reporting without feeling the impacts of a heavy transactional load on the primary database. Each database in the SQL MI Business Critical tier is automatically provisioned with several AlwaysON replicas to support the availability SLA. Using [**Read Scale-Out**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-read-scale-out) allows you to load balance Azure SQL Database read-only workloads utilizing the capacity of one read-only replica.

### Task 1: View Leaderboard report in the WideWorldImporters web application

In this task, you open a web report using the web application you deployed to your App Service.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the Azure services list.

   ![Resource groups is highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-resource-groups.png "Azure services")

2. Select the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group from the list.

   ![Resource groups is selected in the Azure navigation pane, and the "hands-on-lab-SUFFIX" resource group is highlighted.](./media/resource-groups.png "Resource groups list")

3. In the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group, select the **wwi-web-UNIQUEID** App Service from the list of resources.

   ![The App Service resource is selected from the list of resources in the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.](media/rg-app-service.png "hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group")

4. On the App Service overview blade, select the **URL** to open the web application in a browser window.

   ![The App service URL is highlighted.](media/app-service-url.png "App service URL")

5. In the WideWorldImporters web app, select **Leaderboard** from the menu.

   ![READ_WRITE is highlighted on the Leaderboard page.](media/gamer-leaderboard-read-write.png "Gamer Leaderboard within the Web App")

   > Note the `READ_WRITE` string on the page. This message is the output from reading the `Updateability` property associated with the `ApplicationIntent` option on the target database. This can be retrieved using the SQL query `SELECT DATABASEPROPERTYEX(DB_NAME(), "Updateability")`.

### Task 2: Update read-only connection string

In this task, you enable Read Scale-Out for the `WideWorldImporters`database, using the `ApplicationIntent` option in the connection string. This option dictates whether the connection is routed to the write replica or a read-only replica. Specifically, if the `ApplicationIntent` value is `ReadWrite` (the default value), the connection is directed to the database's read-write replica. If the `ApplicationIntent` value is `ReadOnly`, the connection is routed to a read-only replica.

1. Return to the App Service blade in the Azure portal and select **Configuration** under Settings on the left-hand side.

   ![The Configuration item is selected under Settings.](media/app-service-configuration-menu.png "Configuration")

2. On the Configuration blade, scroll down and locate the connection string named `WwiReadOnlyContext` within the **Connection strings** section, and select the Pencil (edit) icon on the right.

   ![The edit icon next to the read-only connection string is highlighted.](media/app-service-configuration-connection-strings-read-only.png "Connection strings")

3. In the Add/Edit connection string dialog, select the **Value** for the `WwiReadOnlyContext` and paste the following parameter to the end of the connection string.

   ```sql
   ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly;
   ```

4. The `WwiReadOnlyContext` connection string should now look something like the following:

   ```sql
   Server=tcp:sqlmi-kmtwpw3nia6n2.15b8611394c5.database.windows.net,1433;Database=WideWorldImporters;User ID=sqlmiuser;Password=Password.1234567890;Trusted_Connection=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly;
   ```

5. Select **OK**.

6. Select **Save** at the top of the Configuration blade, and select **Continue** when prompted about restarting the application.

   ![The save button on the Application settings blade is highlighted.](media/app-service-configuration-save.png "Save")

### Task 3: Reload Leaderboard report in the web app

In this task, you refresh the Leaderboard report in the WideWorldImporters web app and observe the result.

1. Return to the gamer information website you opened previously, and refresh the **Leaderboard** page. The page should now look similar to the following:

   ![READ_ONLY is highlighted on the Reports page.](media/gamer-leaderboard-read-only.png "Gamer Leaderboard Web App")

   > Notice the `updateability` option is now displaying as `READ_ONLY`. With a simple addition to your database connection string, queries can be sent to an online secondary of your SQL MI Business-critical database. This setting allows for load-balancing read-only workloads using the capacity of one read-only replica. The SQL MI Business Critical cluster has a built-in Read Scale-Out capability that provides a free-of-charge built-in read-only node that can be used to run read-only queries that should not affect the performance of your primary workload.

## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 10 minutes

In this exercise, you will de-provision all Azure resources that you created in support of this hands-on lab.

### Task 1: Delete Azure resource groups

1. In the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** from the left-hand menu, and locate and delete the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** following resource group.

   > **Note**: Deleting a resource group containing SQL MI does not always work the first time. The deletion failure can result in a few networking components (route table, SQL MI NSG, and VNet) remaining in the resource group, along with the SQL MI instance, after the first delete attempt. In this case, wait for the first process to complete, and then attempt to delete the resource group a second time. _You may need to allow several hours or more between delete attempts_.

### Task 2: Delete the wide-world-importers service principal

1. In the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory** and then select **App registrations**.

2. Select the **wide-world-importers** application and select **Delete** on the application blade.

You should follow all steps provided _after_ attending the Hands-on lab.
